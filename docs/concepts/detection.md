# Detect

Entity detection is the first stage of every Anonymizer pipeline. Both replace and rewrite modes depend on it.

---

## How it works

Detection combines a lightweight GLiNER2 PII model with LLM-based refinement. GLiNER2 produces an
initial set of entity spans, then an LLM augments it with entities the NER missed and validates each
detection—keeping, reclassifying, or dropping entities based on context.

When rewrite is configured, an additional step identifies **latent entities** -- sensitive information inferable from context but not explicitly stated in the text.

### Example: standard vs. latent entities

Consider this short passage:

> Sarah described her appointment. She's looking forward to ringing the bell soon and said the care team has been wonderful.

| Type | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard entity | Sarah | A directly stated first name. |
| Latent entity | cancer treatment | Inferred from context. The passage never explicitly says "cancer," but "ringing the bell" can imply nearing the end of cancer treatment. |

---

## Configuration

Detection is configured via the `Detect` object on `AnonymizerConfig`:

```python
from anonymizer import AnonymizerConfig, Detect, Redact

config = AnonymizerConfig(
    detect=Detect(),
    replace=Redact(),
)
```

### In-memory records

Applications can pass typed records without first writing a CSV or Parquet file:

```python
from anonymizer import Anonymizer, AnonymizerConfig, Redact, TextRecord, TextRecordsInput

result = Anonymizer().run(
    config=AnonymizerConfig(replace=Redact()),
    data=TextRecordsInput(
        records=[
            TextRecord(id="request-1", text="Email Alice at alice@example.com"),
            TextRecord(id="request-2", text="Bob works at Acme"),
        ],
        data_summary="Application request logs",
    ),
)

entities_by_id = dict(zip(result.dataframe["id"], result.dataframe["final_entities"], strict=True))
```

`result.dataframe` is the public result surface for validated entities. It
retains IDs and input order for records that complete the pipeline. Dropped
records use the same caller-provided IDs in `result.failed_records`. Use
`result.trace_dataframe` only when you need internal pipeline diagnostics.

### Detector-only online API

Applications that need a request-time first pass can call a compatible GLiNER
endpoint without constructing the full Data Designer pipeline or creating
dataset artifacts:

```python
from anonymizer import OnlineDetectConfig, OnlineDetector, TextRecord

records = [TextRecord(id="turn-1", text="Email Alice at alice@example.com")]
config = OnlineDetectConfig(entity_labels=["first_name", "email"])

async with OnlineDetector(
    endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1",
    model="fastino/gliner2-privacy-filter-PII-multi",
    max_concurrency=8,
) as detector:
    results = await detector.detect(records, config=config)
```

`OnlineDetector` sends each non-empty record as one request to
`<endpoint>/chat/completions`. It reuses one asynchronous HTTP client and
applies one concurrency limit across simultaneous `detect()` calls. Results
retain caller IDs and input order. Each span contains a normalized label,
confidence score, and half-open character offsets into the submitted source.
Raw entity values are not stored in the result, and input text is never
mutated. Empty text returns an empty span list without a network request.

The submitted text is visible to the configured detector service. See the
[GLiNER server contract](self-hosting-gliner.md#server-contract) before using a
remote endpoint with sensitive data.

This API is **detector-only**. It skips LLM validation and augmentation, latent
entity detection, replacement, rewriting, and evaluation. It can therefore
produce more false positives and false negatives than the full Anonymizer
pipeline and should not be described as equivalent anonymization. If any
record times out, receives an HTTP error, or returns an unsafe response, the
whole call fails and unfinished sibling requests are cancelled. Callers decide
whether to retry, omit, or fail closed.

### `Detect` fields

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `entity_labels` | `None` (all defaults) | List of labels to detect. Leave unset (or pass `None`) to use the full default set. |
| `excluded_entity_labels` | `None` | List of labels to **never** detect, even if present in `entity_labels` or the default set. Excluded labels are removed before GLiNER and the LLM prompts run, and are also filtered from the final entity output as a safety net. |
| `gliner_threshold` | `0.3` | GLiNER confidence threshold (0.0--1.0). Lower values detect more entities but may increase false positives. |
| `validation_max_entities_per_call` | `100` | Maximum candidate entities per validator LLM call. Rows with more candidates are split into chunks. See [Chunked validation](#chunked-validation). |
| `validation_excerpt_window_chars` | `500` | Characters of context included before and after a chunk's entity spans in the validator prompt. Bounds per-chunk prompt size; not the model's context-window limit. |

---

## Chunked validation

When a row yields many entity candidates, validating them in a single LLM call can often exceed the model's context window or the provider's rate limits (tokens-per-minute or requests-per-minute quotas that many hosted models enforce). Anonymizer automatically splits validation for such rows: candidates are grouped in position order into chunks of at most `validation_max_entities_per_call`, and each chunk is validated independently with its own bounded text excerpt (`validation_excerpt_window_chars` before and after the chunk's span). Decisions are merged back into a single per-row set.

The chunked path is always on; if a row has fewer candidates than the limit, it runs as a single call and is exactly equivalent to the unchunked behavior. Tuning guidance:

- **Raise `validation_max_entities_per_call`** if your validator has a large context window and you want fewer, larger calls.
- **Lower it** if you hit provider rate limits or want more uniform per-call latency.
- **Raise `validation_excerpt_window_chars`** when short windows hide the context needed to disambiguate entities (e.g., `"John"` as first name vs. last name depends on surrounding text).
- **Lower it** to reduce per-chunk prompt tokens, at the risk of lower validation quality on context-sensitive labels.

### Validator pools

`entity_validator` can be a single alias (the default) or a list of aliases — a **pool**. When multiple aliases are configured, each chunk in a row is dispatched to the next alias in round-robin order, which lets you work around per-alias rate limits by spreading requests across equivalent endpoints.

Pools also act as **failover**. If a chunk's assigned alias can't complete the call (an unrecoverable rate limit, a 5xx that didn't clear on retry, a malformed response), the same chunk is automatically retried against the other aliases in your pool before the row is given up on. A chunk only fails once every alias in the pool has failed for it. This is a cheap way to harden validation against any one endpoint having a bad day, on top of the load-spreading role.

#### What happens when a row can't be validated

If validation can't get a complete answer for a row — every alias in the pool has failed on at least one of that row's chunks — the row is **dropped from the output** rather than passed through with some entities unvalidated. This is deliberate: the alternative would be writing the original text back out with those entities still un-scrubbed, which is an undesired outcome.

Dropped rows show up on `result.failed_records` with `step="detection"`, so you can tell which inputs didn't make it through by comparing input IDs against output IDs and reprocess those on a follow-up pass.

See [Validator pools](models.md#validator-pools) for the YAML syntax and caveats.


## Entity labels

Anonymizer ships with a comprehensive default label set covering:

- **Direct identifiers** (e.g. `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `ssn`, `date_of_birth`, `street_address`)
- **Quasi-identifiers** (e.g. `age`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `occupation`, `company_name`, `date`)
- **Technical data** (e.g. `api_key`, `password`, `url`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `device_identifier`)
- **Demographics** (e.g. `gender`, `race_ethnicity`, `religious_belief`, `political_view`, `language`)
- **Financial** (e.g. `credit_debit_card`, `account_number`, `bank_routing_number`, `tax_id`)

To inspect the full list:

```python
from anonymizer import DEFAULT_ENTITY_LABELS
print(DEFAULT_ENTITY_LABELS)
```

### Custom labels

When you pass `entity_labels` explicitly, the augmenter operates in **strict mode** -- it only outputs entities matching your list. When `entity_labels=None`, the augmenter can create additional labels beyond the defaults (e.g., `clinic_name`, `server_name`).

```python
# Strict: only detect these 3 labels
Detect(entity_labels=["first_name", "last_name", "email"])

# Permissive: detect all defaults + LLM can infer new label types
Detect()  # entity_labels=None
```

### Excluding entity labels

Use `excluded_entity_labels` to omit specific labels from detection without having to enumerate the entire allowlist. Excluded labels are removed before GLiNER runs and before the LLM prompts are built, so they are never detected or augmented.

```python
# Detect all defaults except occupation and gender
Detect(excluded_entity_labels=["occupation", "gender"])

# Combine with an explicit allowlist — exclusions always win
Detect(entity_labels=["first_name", "email", "city"], excluded_entity_labels=["city"])
```

!!! warning
    `excluded_entity_labels` is always checked against the effective allowlist — `entity_labels` if set, otherwise `DEFAULT_ENTITY_LABELS`. A total overlap raises a `ValueError` at config time instead of silently detecting nothing. A partial overlap logs a warning only when `entity_labels` is explicit; against the default label set, it's silent.

## Tuning the threshold

For `gliner_threshold`, start with the default `0.3`. If you're seeing too many false positives, raise it to `0.5`. If entities are being missed, try lowering to `0.2`. The LLM validation step catches many false positives, so erring on the side of lower thresholds is usually safe.

---

## Model roles

The detection pipeline uses three model roles, each mapped to a model alias in the default config:

| Role | Default alias | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `entity_detector` | [`gliner-pii-detector`](https://huggingface.co/fastino/gliner2-privacy-filter-PII-multi) | GLiNER2 PII model, served through a compatible local endpoint. |
| `entity_validator` | [`gpt-oss-120b`](https://openrouter.ai/openai/gpt-oss-120b) | Validates and reclassifies detected entities. |
| `entity_augmenter` | [`gpt-oss-120b`](https://openrouter.ai/openai/gpt-oss-120b) | Finds entities the NER model missed. |
| `latent_detector` | [`nemotron-30b-thinking`](https://openrouter.ai/nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b) | Identifies inferable entities (rewrite only). |

See [Models](models.md) for how to override these.
